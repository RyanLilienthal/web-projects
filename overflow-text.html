 <h1>The Collector</h1>
 <br>
 <h4>
   We save<br>
   Unique among us<br> 
   Mom saved what "they are wearing"<br>
   And everything else<br>
   From one decade to the next<br>
   What they are wearing filled closets<br>
   Then boxes<br>
   Then basements<br>
  <br>
   Then mom died<br>
   Then a storage unit filled<br> 
   With images and things of the ages<br>
   An archive of existence<br>
  <br>
   Now mom's overflow<br>
   Flows into my attic <br>
   With my stuff<br>
   <br>

   <h1>Stuffing</h1>
   <br>
   My mother-in-law hosts Thanksgiving.<br>
   Each year she stuffs the turkey<br>
   With all sorts of stuff<br>
   I help with set up<br>
   Which doesn't require stuff<br>
  <br>
   She purges<br>
   Her closets<br>
   Her boxes<br>
   Her basement<br>
   Of clutter.<br>
  Hence<br>
   Unfettered access to tables and chairs<br>
   She says she wants to make it easier.<br>
   To leave less stuff<br>
   When she dies.<br>
   <br>
