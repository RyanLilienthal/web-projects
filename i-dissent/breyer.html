    <span class="tab">The procedural posture of this case leads a majority of
    this Court to deny the applicants’ request for provisional
    relief. In my view, however, we should grant that request.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>
    I agree with <span class="small-cap">  The Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Sotomayor</span>and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan</span>. Texas’s law delegates to private individuals the power to prevent a woman from obtaining an
    abortion during the first stage of pregnancy. But a woman
    has a federal constitutional right to obtain an abortion during that first stage. <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
    Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833, 846 (1992); <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410
    U. S. 113, 164 (1973). And a “State cannot delegate . . . a
    veto power [over the right to obtain an abortion] which the
    state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.” <i>Planned
    Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 69
    (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, we have
    made clear that “since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage . . . the State cannot
    delegate authority to any particular person . . . to prevent
    abortion during that same period.” <i>Ibid.</i> The applicants
    persuasively argue that Texas’s law does precisely that.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>The very bringing into effect of Texas’s law may well
    threaten the applicants with imminent and serious harm.
    One of the clinic applicants has stated on its website that “[d]ue to Texas’ SB 8 law,” it is “unable to provide abortion
    procedures at this time.” Planned Parenthood South Texas,
    https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthoodsouth-texas. And the applicants, with supporting affidavits, claim that clinics will be unable to run the financial
    and other risks that come from waiting for a private person
    to sue them under the Texas law; they will simply close,
    depriving care to more than half the women seeking abortions in Texas clinics. See, e.g., App. to Application 105,
    148–150, 178–179. We have permitted those whom a law
    threatens with constitutional harm to bring pre-enforcement challenges to the law where the harm is less serious
    and the threat of enforcement less certain than the harm
    (and the threat) here. See <i>Virginia v. American Booksellers
    Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U. S. 383, 392–393 (1988); <i>Babbitt v. Farm
    Workers,</i> 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979); see also <i>Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149,</i> 164 (2014) (finding
    substantial threat of future enforcement where statute permits “‘any person’” to file a complaint and “the universe of
    potential complainants is not restricted”).<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>I recognize that Texas’s law delegates the State’s power
    to prevent abortions not to one person (such as a district
    attorney) or to a few persons (such as a group of government
    officials or private citizens) but to any person. But I do not
    see why that fact should make a critical legal difference.
    That delegation still threatens to invade a constitutional
    right, and the coming into effect of that delegation still
    threatens imminent harm. Normally, where a legal right is
    “‘invaded,’” the law provides “‘a legal remedy by suit or action at law.’” <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803)
    (quoting 3 W. Blackstone Commentaries *23). It should
    prove possible to apply procedures adequate to that task
    here, perhaps by permitting lawsuits against a subset of
    delegatees (say, those particularly likely to exercise the delegated powers), or perhaps by permitting lawsuits against officials whose actions are necessary to implement the statute’s enforcement powers. There may be other not-verynew procedural bottles that can also adequately hold what
    is, in essence, very old and very important legal wine: The
    ability to ask the Judiciary to protect an individual from the
    invasion of a constitutional right—an invasion that threatens immediate and serious injury.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>As <span class="small-cap">The Chief Justice Roberts</span> writes, this Court should not permit the law to take effect without assuring the applicants
    (and the respondents) an opportunity first and fully to
    make (or to refute) these and other arguments supporting
    the request for an injunction.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>For these reasons, and for the reasons stated by <span class="small-cap">  The Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Sotomayor</span>, and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan,</span><br>
    <span class="tab"></span>I dissent.
