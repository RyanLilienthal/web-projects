    <span class="tab"></span><span class="small-cap">  Justice Breyer</span>, with whom <span class="small-cap">Justice Sotomayor </span>and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan</span> join, dissenting.<br>
    <span class="tab">The procedural posture of this case leads a majority of
    this Court <span class="expand">to deny</span> the applicants’ request for provisional
    relief. In my view, however, we should grant that request.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>
    I agree with <span class="small-cap">  The Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Sotomayor</span>and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan</span>. Texas’s law delegates to private individuals the power <span class="expand">to prevent</span> a woman from obtaining an
    abortion during the first stage of pregnancy. But a woman
    has a federal constitutional right <span class="expand">to obtain</span> an abortion during that first stage. <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
    Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833, 846 (1992); <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410
    U. S. 113, 164 (1973). And a “State cannot delegate . . . a
    veto power [over the right <span class="expand">to obtain</span> an abortion] which the
    state itself is absolutely and totally prohibited from exercising during the first trimester of pregnancy.” <i>Planned
    Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,</i> 428 U. S. 52, 69
    (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, we have
    made clear that “since the State cannot regulate or proscribe abortion during the first stage . . . the State cannot
    delegate authority to any particular person . . . <span class="expand">to prevent</span>
    abortion during that same period.” <i>Ibid.</i> The applicants
    persuasively argue that Texas’s law does precisely that.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>The very bringing into effect of Texas’s law may well
    threaten the applicants with imminent and serious harm.
    One of the clinic applicants has stated on its website that “[d]ue to Texas’ SB 8 law,” it is “unable <span class="expand">to provide</span> abortion
    procedures at this time.” Planned Parenthood South Texas,
    https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthoodsouth-texas. And the applicants, with supporting affidavits, claim that clinics will be unable <span class="expand">to run</span> the financial
    and other risks that come from waiting for a private person
    <span class="expand">to sue</span> them under the Texas law; they will simply close,
    depriving care to more than half the women seeking abortions in Texas clinics. See, e.g., App. to Application 105,
    148–150, 178–179. We have permitted those whom a law
    threatens with constitutional harm <span class="expand">to bring</span> pre-enforcement challenges to the law where the harm is less serious
    and the threat of enforcement less certain than the harm
    (and the threat) here. See <i>Virginia v. American Booksellers
    Assn., Inc.,</i> 484 U. S. 383, 392–393 (1988); <i>Babbitt v. Farm
    Workers,</i> 442 U. S. 289, 298 (1979); see also <i>Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U. S. 149,</i> 164 (2014) (finding
    substantial threat of future enforcement where statute permits “‘any person’” <span class="expand">to file</span> a complaint and “the universe of
    potential complainants is not restricted”).<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>I recognize that Texas’s law delegates the State’s power
    <span class="expand">to prevent</span> abortions not to one person (such as a district
    attorney) or to a few persons (such as a group of government
    officials or private citizens) but to any person. But I do not
    see why that fact should make a critical legal difference.
    That delegation still threatens <span class="expand">to invade</span> a constitutional
    right, and the coming into effect of that delegation still
    threatens imminent harm. Normally, where a legal right is
    “‘invaded,’” the law provides “‘a legal remedy by suit or action at law.’” <i>Marbury v. Madison,</i> 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803)
    (quoting 3 W. Blackstone Commentaries *23). It should
    prove possible <span class="expand">to apply</span> procedures adequate to that task
    here, perhaps by permitting lawsuits against a subset of
    delegatees (say, those particularly likely <span class="expand">to exercise</span> the delegated powers), or perhaps by permitting lawsuits against officials whose actions are necessary <span class="expand">to implement</span> the statute’s enforcement powers. There may be other not-verynew procedural bottles that can also adequately hold what
    is, in essence, very old and very important legal wine: The
    ability <span class="expand">to ask</span> the Judiciary <span class="expand">to protect</span> an individual from the
    invasion of a constitutional right—an invasion that threatens immediate and serious injury.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>As <span class="small-cap">The Chief Justice Roberts</span> writes, this Court should not permit the law <span class="expand">to take</span> effect without assuring the applicants
    (and the respondents) an opportunity first and fully <span class="expand">to
    make</span> (or <span class="expand">to refute</span>) these and other arguments supporting
    the request for an injunction.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>For these reasons, and for the reasons stated by <span class="small-cap">  The Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Sotomayor</span>, and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan,</span><br>
    <span class="tab"></span>I dissent.
