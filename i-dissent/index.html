                The application for injunctive relief or, in the alternative,
                to vacate stays of the district court proceedings presented
                to <span class="small-cap">Justice Alito</span> and by him referred to the Court is denied. To prevail in an application for a stay or an injunction, an applicant must carry the burden of making a
                “strong showing” that it is “likely to succeed on the merits,”
                that it will be “irreparably injured absent a stay,” that the
                balance of the equities favors it, and that a stay is consistent with the public interest. <i>Nken v. Holder,</i> 556 U. S.
                418, 434 (2009); <i>Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v.
                Cuomo,</i> 141 S. Ct. 63, 66 (2020) (citing <i>Winter v. Natural
                Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 555 U. S. 7, 20 (2008)). The
                applicants now before us have raised serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law at issue. But
                their application also presents complex and novel antecedent procedural questions on which they have not carried
                their burden. For example, federal courts enjoy the power
                to enjoin individuals tasked with enforcing laws, not the
                laws themselves. <i>California v. Texas,</i> 593 U. S. ___, ___
                (2021) (slip op., at 8). And it is unclear whether the named
                defendants in this lawsuit can or will seek to enforce the
                Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might
                permit our intervention. <i>Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA,</i> 568
                U. S. 398, 409 (2013) (“threatened injury must be certainly
                impending” (citation omitted)). The State has represented that neither it nor its executive employees possess the authority to enforce the Texas law either directly or indirectly.
                Nor is it clear whether, under existing precedent, this Court
                can issue an injunction against state judges asked to decide
                a lawsuit under Texas’s law. See <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S.
                123, 163 (1908). Finally, the sole private-citizen respondent
                before us has filed an affidavit stating that he has no present intention to enforce the law. In light of such issues, we
                cannot say the applicants have met their burden to prevail
                in an injunction or stay application. In reaching this conclusion, we stress that we do not purport to resolve definitively any jurisdictional or substantive claim in the applicants’ lawsuit. In particular, this order is not based on any
                conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in
                no way limits other procedurally proper challenges to the
                Texas law, including in Texas state courts.<br><br>
                <span class="tab"></span><span class="small-cap">  Chief Justice Roberts</span>, with whom <span class="small-cap">Justice Breyer</span>
                and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan</span> join, dissenting.
                 The statutory scheme before the Court is not only unusual, but unprecedented. The legislature has imposed a
                prohibition on abortions after roughly six weeks, and then
                essentially delegated enforcement of that prohibition to the
                populace at large. The desired consequence appears to be
                to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing
                and enforcing the regulatory regime.
                 The State defendants argue that they cannot be restrained from enforcing their rules because they do not enforce them in the first place. I would grant preliminary relief to preserve the status quo ante—before the law went
                into effect—so that the courts may consider whether a state
                can avoid responsibility for its laws in such a manner. Defendants argue that existing doctrines preclude judicial intervention, and they may be correct. See <i>California v.
                Texas,</i> 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 8). But the con-sequences of approving the state action, both in this particular case and as a model for action in other areas, counsel
                at least preliminary judicial consideration before the program devised by the State takes effect.
                We are at this point asked to resolve these novel questions—at least preliminarily—in the first instance, in the
                course of two days, without the benefit of consideration by
                the District Court or Court of Appeals. We are also asked
                to do so without ordinary merits briefing and without oral
                argument. These questions are particularly difficult, including for example whether the exception to sovereign immunity recognized in <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908),
                should extend to state court judges in circumstances such
                as these.
                I would accordingly preclude enforcement of S. B. 8 by the
                respondents to afford the District Court and the Court of
                Appeals the opportunity to consider the propriety of judicial
                action and preliminary relief pending consideration of the
                plaintiffs’ claims.
                Although the Court denies the applicants’ request for
                emergency relief today, the Court’s order is emphatic in
                making clear that it cannot be understood as sustaining the
                constitutionality of the law at issue. But although the
                Court does not address the constitutionality of this law, it
                can of course promptly do so when that question is properly
                presented. At such time the question could be decided after
                full briefing and oral argument, with consideration of
                whether interim relief is appropriate should enforcement of
                the law be allowed below.
