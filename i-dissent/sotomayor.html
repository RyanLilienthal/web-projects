    <span class="tab"></span></span>The Court’s order is stunning<span class="stand-alone">. Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, </span>a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand<span class="stand-alone">. Last night, </span>the Court silently acquiesced<span class="stand-alone"> in a State’s enactment of a law that flouts nearly 50 years of federal precedents. Today, </span>the Court belatedly explains<span class="stand-alone"> that it declined to grant relief because of procedural complexities of the State’s own invention. Ante, at 1. Because </span>the Court’s failure to act rewards tactics<span class="stand-alone"> designed </span>to avoid judicial review<span class="stand-alone"> and </span>inflicts significant harm<span class="stand-alone"> on the applicants and on women seeking abortions in Texas, I dissent.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>In May 2021, the Texas Legislature enacted S. B. 8 (the Act). The Act, which took effect statewide at midnight on September 1, makes it unlawful for physicians to perform abortions if they either detect cardiac activity in an embryo or fail to perform a test to detect such activity. §3 (to be codified at Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§171.201(1), 171.204(a) (West 2021)). This equates to a near-categorical ban on abortions beginning six weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, before many women realize they are pregnant, and months before fetal viability. According to the applicants, who are abortion providers and advocates in Texas, the Act immediately prohibits care for at least 85%
    of Texas abortion patients and will force many abortion
    clinics to close.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>The Act is clearly unconstitutional under existing precedents. See, e.g., <i>June Medical Servs. L. L. C. v. Russo,</i> 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (<span class="small-cap">ROBERTS, C. J.,</span> concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 5) (explaining that “the State may not
    impose an undue burden on the woman’s ability to obtain
    an abortion” of a “nonviable fetus” (citing <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey,</i> 505 U. S. 833 (1992); internal quotation marks omitted)). The respondents do not even try to argue otherwise. Nor could they: No federal appellate court has upheld such a comprehensive prohibition on abortions before viability under current law.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>The Texas Legislature was well aware of this binding
    precedent. To circumvent it, the Legislature took the extraordinary step of enlisting private citizens to do what the
    State could not. The Act authorizes any private citizen to
    file a lawsuit against any person who provides an abortion
    in violation of the Act, “aids or abets” such an abortion (including by paying for it) regardless of whether they know
    the abortion is prohibited under the Act, or even intends to
    engage in such conduct. §3 (to be codified at Tex. Health &
    Safety Code Ann. §171.208). Courts are required to enjoin
    the defendant from engaging in these actions in the future
    and to award the private-citizen plaintiff at least $10,000
    in “statutory damages” for each forbidden abortion performed or aided by the defendant. <i>Ibid.</i> In effect, the Texas
    Legislature has deputized the State’s citizens as bounty
    hunters, offering them cash prizes for civilly prosecuting
    their neighbors’ medical procedures.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>
    The Legislature fashioned this scheme because federal
    constitutional challenges to state laws ordinarily are
    brought against state officers who are in charge of enforcing
    the law. See, e.g., <i>Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy v. Stewart,</i> 563 U. S. 247, 254 (2011) (citing <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908)). By prohibiting state officers from enforcing the Act directly and relying instead on citizen bounty hunters, the Legislature sought to make it more complicated for federal courts to enjoin the Act on a statewide basis.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>Taken together, the Act is a breathtaking act of defiance—of the Constitution, of this Court’s precedents, and of the rights of women seeking abortions throughout Texas. But over six weeks after the applicants filed suit to prevent the Act from taking effect, a Fifth Circuit panel abruptly stayed all proceedings before the District Court and vacated a preliminary injunction hearing that was scheduled to begin on Monday. The applicants requested emergency relief from this Court, but </span>the Court said nothing<span class="stand-alone">. The Act took effect at midnight last night.*<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>Today, </span>the Court finally tells the Nation that it declined to act<span class="stand-alone"> because, in short, the State’s gambit worked. The structure of the State’s scheme, the Court reasons, raises “complex and novel antecedent procedural questions” that counsel against granting the application, ante, at 1, just as the State intended. This is untenable. It cannot be the case that a State can evade federal judicial scrutiny by outsourcing the enforcement of unconstitutional laws to its citizenry. Moreover, the District Court held this case justiciable in a thorough and well-reasoned opinion after weeks of briefing and consideration. 2021 WL 3821062, *8–*26 (WD Tex., Aug. 25, 2021). At a minimum, </span>this Court should have stayed implementation<span class="stand-alone"> of the Act to allow the lower courts to evaluate these issues in the normal course. Ante, at 2 (<span class="small-cap">Roberts, C. J., </span>dissenting). Instead, </span>the Court has rewarded<span class="stand-alone"> the State’s effort to delay federal review of </span>a plainly unconstitutional statute<span class="stand-alone">, enacted in </span>disregard of the Court’s precedents<span class="stand-alone">, through </span>procedural entanglements<span class="stand-alone"> of the State’s own creation.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span></span>The Court should not be so content<span class="stand-alone"> to ignore its constitutional obligations to protect not only the rights of women, but also the sanctity of its precedents and of the rule of law.<br>
    <span class="tab"></span>I dissent.

  * </span><span class="footnote">The Court’s inaction has had immediate impact.<span class="stand-alone"> Two hours before
the Act took effect, one applicant reported that its waiting rooms were
“ ‘filled with patients” ’ urgently seeking care while “ ‘protesters [we]re
outside, shining lights on the parking [lot].’ ” De Vogue, Texas 6-Week
Abortion Ban Takes Effect after Supreme Court Inaction, CNN (Sept. 1,
2021), www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/politics/texas-abortion-supreme-courtsb8-roe-wade/index.html. Then, at midnight, the Act became law, and
many abortion providers, including applicants, ceased providing abortion
care after more than six weeks from a woman’s last menstrual period
(LMP). See, <i>e.g.</i>, Alamo Women’s Reproductive Care (Sept. 1, 2021),
https://alamowomensclinic.com (“We cannot provide abortion services to
anyone with detectable embryonic or fetal cardiac activity[,] which is typically found at 6 weeks or more from last menstrual period”); Southwestern Women’s Surgery Center (Sept. 1, 2021), https://southwesternwomens.com/southwestern-womens-surgery-center-dallas-texas/ (“In
compliance with Texas Senate Bill 8 of 2021, starting on September 1st
2021, our facility cannot provide abortions to patients with detectible embryonic or fetal cardiac activity, which typically starts at 6 weeks LMP”).
Since then, at least one applicant has stopped providing abortions entirely. Planned Parenthood South Texas (Sept. 1, 2021),
https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-south-texas
(“Due to Texas’ SB 8 law, we are unable to provide abortion procedures at this time”).</span></span>
