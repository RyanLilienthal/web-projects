      <span class="redact"><span class="tab"></span>The application for </span>injunctive<span class="redact"> relief or, in the alternative,
      to vacate stays of the district court proceedings presented
      to <span class="small-cap">Justice Alito</span> and by him referred to the Court is denied. To prevail in an application for a stay or an injunction, an applicant must carry the </span>burden<span class="redact"> of making a
      “strong showing” that it is “likely to succeed on the merits,”
      that it will be “</span>irreparably injured<span class="redact"> absent a stay,” that the
      balance of the </span>equities<span class="redact"> favors it, and that a stay is consistent with the public interest. <i>Nken v. Holder,</i> 556 U. S.
      418, 434 (2009); <i>Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v.
      Cuomo,</i> 141 S. Ct. 63, 66 (2020) (citing <i>Winter v. Natural
      Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 555 U. S. 7, 20 (2008)). The
      applicants now before us have </span>raised<span class="redact"> serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law at issue. But
      their application also presents complex and </span>novel antecedent<span class="redact"> procedural questions on which they have not carried
      their burden. For example, federal courts enjoy the </span>power<span class="redact">
      to </span>enjoin individuals<span class="redact"> tasked with </span>enforcing<span class="redact"> laws, not the
      laws themselves. <i>California v. Texas,</i> 593 U. S. ___, ___
      (2021) (slip op., at 8). And it is </span>unclear<span class="redact"> whether the named
      </span>defendants<span class="redact"> in this lawsuit can or will seek to enforce the
      Texas law against the applicants </span>in a manner<span class="redact"> that might
      permit our intervention. <i>Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA,</i> 568
      U. S. 398, 409 (2013) (“</span>threatened injury<span class="redact"> must be certainly
      </span>impending<span class="redact">” (citation omitted)). The State has represented that neither it nor its executive employees possess the </span>authority<span class="redact"> to enforce the Texas law either directly or indirectly.
      Nor is it clear whether, under existing precedent, this Court
      can issue an injunction against state </span>judges<span class="redact"> asked to decide
      a lawsuit under Texas’s law. See <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S.
      123, 163 (1908). Finally, </span>the sole private-citizen<span class="redact"> respondent
      before us has filed an affidavit stating that he has no present intention to enforce the law. </span>In light of<span class="redact"> such issues, we
      cannot say the applicants have met </span>their burden<span class="redact"> to prevail
      in an injunction or stay application. In reaching this conclusion, </span>we stress<span class="redact"> that we do not purport to resolve definitively any jurisdictional or substantive claim in the applicants’ lawsuit. In particular, this order is not based on any
      conclusion about the constitutionality of Texas’s law, and in
      no way limits other procedurally proper </span>challenges to<span class="redact"> the
      Texas law, including in Texas state courts.<br><br>
      <span class="tab"></span><span class="small-cap">  Chief Justice Roberts</span>, with whom <span class="small-cap">Justice Breyer</span>
      and <span class="small-cap">Justice Kagan</span> join, dissenting.
        </span>The statutory scheme<span class="redact"> before the Court is not only unusual, but unprecedented. The legislature has imposed a
      prohibition on abortions after roughly six weeks, and then
      essentially </span>delegated enforcement<span class="redact"> of that prohibition to the
      populace at large. The desired consequence appears to be
      to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing
      and enforcing the regulatory regime.<br>
      <span class="tab"></span>
      The State defendants argue that they </span>cannot be restrained<span class="redact"> from enforcing their rules because they do not enforce them in the first place. I would grant preliminary relief to preserve the status quo ante—before the law went
      into effect—so that the courts may consider whether a state
      can avoid responsibility for its laws in such a manner. Defendants argue that existing doctrines preclude judicial intervention, and they may be correct. See <i>California v.
      Texas,</i> 593 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (slip op., at 8). But the con-sequences of approving the state action, both in this particular case and </span>as a model<span class="redact"> for action in other areas, counsel
      at least preliminary judicial consideration before the program devised by the State </span>takes effect.<span class="redact"><br>
      <span class="tab"></span>We are at this point asked to resolve these novel questions—at least preliminarily—in the first instance, in the
      course of two days, </span>without the benefit<span class="redact"> of consideration by
      the District Court or Court of Appeals. We are also asked
      to do so </span>without ordinary merits<span class="redact"> briefing and without oral
      argument. These questions are particularly difficult, including for example whether </span>the exception to sovereign<span class="redact"> immunity recognized in <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U. S. 123 (1908),
      should extend to state court judges in </span>circumstances<span class="redact"> such
      as these.<br>
      <span class="tab"></span>I would accordingly </span>preclude<span class="redact"> enforcement of S. B. 8 by the
      respondents to afford the District Court and the Court of
      Appeals the opportunity to consider the propriety of judicial
      action and preliminary relief pending consideration of the
      plaintiffs’ </span>claims<span class="redact">.<br>
      <span class="tab"></span>
      Although the Court denies the applicants’ request for
      </span>emergency<span class="redact"> relief today, the Court’s order is </span>emphatic<span class="redact"> in
      making clear that </span>it cannot be understood<span class="redact"> as sustaining the
      constitutionality of the law at issue. But although the
      Court </span>does not address<span class="redact"> the constitutionality of this law, it
      can of course promptly do so when </span>that question<span class="redact"> is properly
      presented. At such time </span>the question<span class="redact"> could be decided after
      full briefing and oral argument, with consideration of
      whether interim relief is appropriate should enforcement of
      the law be allowed below.
