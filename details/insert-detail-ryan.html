    <mark><h1>A shadow casts</h1> <br>
    <br>
    <h3>From my hand onto the paper on which Iâ€™ll draw</h3></mark><br>
    <br>
    The <button>shadow</button> ... <cite>living</cite> in <button>shadows</button> of <sup>currents</sup> that <sub>crumble</sub> <br>
    <br>
    <h1>From one prompt to another,</h1> <ins>drawn</ins> into the <mark>light</mark>. A <em><button>penumbra</em> born</button> from a drawn object. A <select>fundamental right</select> that has lost its <small>foundation</small>. A current that crumbles from Supreme jurors, which we all must follow. Must we? <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Do we have a <details>choice</details> when <strong>choice is in the balance.</h4> The <u>balance, justice <s>blinded</s></u> by the winds of <q>words</q> formed by crashing currents, cross currents ... we live adrift unmoored by penumbra lost at sea lost from objects, lost from their anchors.</strong> <br>
    <br>
    <h6>I won't grow up chasing the cast of oneself disappearing onto paper of a shadow docket.</h6>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>From my hand</h1>
    <br>
    My hand ... a hand that can hold and wrap fingers. An opposing thumb. Grasping identity with prints as a babe, and lines to be read, between the lines of what's ahead. A tool of creation, of Creation and revelation. Sistine extends Michelangelo's hand into immortality. A finger's touch, an extension outstretched, and over time darkened in candlelight's remorse reaching, itself, for the heavens but rebuffed in place. Soot-staining the ages. Sight giving way to sound. Chanting ritual verse reverberating and echoing, power lurching near and far until time returns to the ceiling begging for lost luster. A new hand, a new touch to touch the spark of creation with greater clarity with new sense.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Penumbra lost</h1><br>
    <br>
    Behind an object, an objective, and objective right, a fundamental right, but not in plain language. Inferred, implied, breathing life into words not stuck in place for looking back, turned to stone and sinking. What says Lot? Of the shadow cast now in shadow. A penumbra of the supreme docket, in hiding and opaque, the dagger is descends from the shadow. Not even the hands are seen. <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Crashing currents</h1><br>
    <br>
    Boats embark from misery's shores cast out from life's giving womb, wombs of endless past that reach their end at the break of tides. Alone but cramped and crammed the waves lap at their bodies caught in the purgatory between here and there, the firmament and ocean playing tug-o-war over the deep. This is no place like home, home, home. Ruby red squelched further by greens and blues slapping the abyss against their craft. Will ... will their handicraft suffice the cross-currents from near and far that want them no more. There's no place like home to heal on distant shores.
