    <mark><h1>I’m looking</h1> into a mirror making a contour drawing of myself</mark><br>
    <br>
    I'm looking ... sight is my go-to sense. Before the day breaks my eyelids crack open. The flow of everyday life on the move. Dialating <em>eyes</em> adjusting to the dark. The dark gives way to more light from within, then with out. Shoulders, arms, ribs, legs, feet follow suit. ... A mirror ... an exact replica, one I can following from point to point to point, and the other objects that take shape depending on where I place my feet. My perspective. My perseptive may change. ... Contour ... understanding the topography, the topography around oneself, the topography that is oneself.

    <mark><h1>I start by placing my pen</h1> ... and it’s an ordinary pen that I hold between my thumb, index finger, and middle finger.</mark><br>
    <br>
    Placing my pen ... location and tool come together to create. A dot, a line, a shape, a form, an object. A tool of design, make possible ... easier a shift from oral transmission to a place ... <cite>placing</cite> .. a place of greater solitude. Is it aloneness ... loneliness? Placing pen happens alone .. but not here ... the words are codes, writing in code. Writing inside a code ... about writing in code. Where is my thumb, index finger, and middle finger. My index.com finger ... a code that doesn't need a pen, but that's where the contours of this experience may have begun. As details come together with this coded expression.

    <mark><h1>A shadow casts</h1> from my hand onto the paper on which I’ll draw</mark><br>
    <br>
    The shadow ... living in shadows of currents that crumble from one prompt to another, drawn into the light. A penumbra born from a drawn object. A fundamental right that has lost its foundation. A current that crumbles from Supreme jurors, which we all must follow. Must we? Do we have a choice when <strong>choice is in the balance. The balance, justice blinded by the winds of words formed by crashing currents, cross currents ... we live adrift unmoored by penumbra lost at sea lost from objects, lost from their anchors.</strong> I won't grow up chasing the cast of oneself disappearing onto paper of a shadow docket.
