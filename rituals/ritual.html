      <h1>Ritual</h1>
      <br>
      <p>What are the rituals you engage in to enter/exit the creative space?<br>
        <br>
        A blank canvas feels like the smooth surface of a newly opened jar of peanut butter. Mmmm hmmmm.<br>
        That smooth surface doesn't come easily.<br>
        For years, I know paint on wooden panels. I love the resistence of the surface.<br>
        The ritual starts at Jerry's the candy shop for kids like me.<br>
        Scoping the aisles for different sizes and craddle widths.<br>
        Then, selecting a gesso.<br>
        But, maybe my gesso vats at home will work.<br>
        Setting up at table at home, in the basement.<br>
        Lather the interior surface of the craddled wooden panel, and the exterior surface.<br>
        Let dry.<br>
        Sand.<br>
        Repeat.<br>
        Repeat<br>
        Load and level the easel.<br>
        Set up the palette, medium, thinner.<br>
        Create a tonal underpainting.<br>
        Find and lose the subject, again, and again, and again<br>
        Layer in hue, tint, and gloss<br>
        Destroy, distupt, find, lose, again, and again, and again.<br>
