	<h1><ins>Spectator</ins></h1><br>
    <br>
Watching with hands shouting gale winds at mounds, down the line, between the bags, with visions of one’s small self or smaller self in combat confronted by another pawn of one’s existence.<br>
<br>

The unexplained flood that clasps steel wires bent around flesh through which one stares<br>
Down or up the balancing act that trembles on future throws. <br>
<br>
In the throws, pounding heart moored in place washed over <br>
<br>
By waves so easy at a distance without stake <br>
A claim on another’s and others in line for tomorrow’s prize if today’s sorrows quelch Casey’s moment.<br>
<br>
Batted about not unlike prosecutor’s court where generations culminate.<br>
<br>
<cite>Alone<br>
Alone<br>
Alone</cite><br>
<br>
Unnursed and naked <br>
<br>
Abandoned.<br> 
<br>
Flailing progenitors lost on the river flowing <br>
Up the mountain of dreams<br>
In search of promises<br>
<br>
For what?<br>
<br>
Honey’s milk suckled so sweet on small days<br>
When every touch grasped new worlds of wonder<br>
Primary reds, yellows, blues sang lullabies from moment to moment<br>
<br>
Then down the slide with those pushed too far into the night<br>
In the darkness the monster clasps steel wires but does not know why<br>
Looking through, in or out, waiting for the break of day<br>
<br>
Light touch fingers curved threads red in a twisting hurl on which sunrises ahead sink<br>
Across pastime’s sand <br>
In bags eyes<br>
Say yes to spike and spite <br>
<br>
<cite>Go<br>
Go<br>
Go</cite><br>
<br>
The omnipresent echo to get there from there.<br>
Lost in a wilderness made by others’ hands<br>
<br>
Safe from the descending storm<br>
For now <br>
Relieved<br>
From the weight foisted from after to before to after<br>
And after <br>
Mirror clouds swing and collide time pendulums <br>
The clocks tick by begging to advance<br>
Scoring pages that make easy rips in the hands of the Spectator.<br>
<br>

"Statements become interconnected by being grammatically congruent; unlike things, made alike gram­matically, become meaningful in common and jointly." (p. 6)<br>
<br>
"In the gap between what one wants to say (or what one per­ceives there is to say) and what one can say (what is sayable), words provide for a collaboration and a desertion." (p.15) <br>
