    Going home<br>
    Leaving home<br>
    Jacob at the river<br>
    Seeking form or returning to it, or crafting it from the banks from the space within from the negative space<br>
    Is the void inside or out? Can anything be grasped or is all motion? It hands submerge but can hold onto to nothing. Living in shadows of currents that crumble.<br>
    Red in front green within an archetypical confrontation bridging time and space seeking a name from the intangible. <br>
    Fleeing and saving and warning and guidancing and guiding and harboring.<br>
    There's no place like home  There's no place like  home there  's  place like home  like home.
