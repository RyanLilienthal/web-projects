         <p>... before and after and before and after ...  red and green and white plaid curtains in the living room, which then reappeared in the family room after the move.  And another move, and another move, and another move, and another move, and another move, and another move, and another move, and another move, and another move. What was green, floral carpet in the kitchen, next to the front door, now down the hall and floors spattered with food and dropped spoons and laughing and making and cleaning and changing and teaching and arguing and hugging and listening ... all in the kitchen. Silence to noise to growing silence. hiding in the closet, under the stair cavity where it bent, under the coats, behind the shoes where I only I could fit. Where I could not fit and pretending not to finding couunting down from 10 to 9 to 8 ... 3,2,1 ready or not here I come and I could hear and but pass the giggling voice right here in search of wonder, or trying to make it. Richard Nixon raising his arms, weakly, but trying strongly, with the victory sign before boarding the helicopter. When impeachment meant something that even a president would resign. I remember visiting Cape Canaveral and astronaut action figures.  Jimmy Carter and peanuts and long gas lines, and huge chocolate chip cookies from diners. painted walls and shag rugs and bell bottoms and cowboy boots. New buildings and homes, like my school with flat roofs and wall-less classrooms, or walls that fell short of the ceiling. And bowling, when life followed the Brady Bunch cycle ... who lives like that?
