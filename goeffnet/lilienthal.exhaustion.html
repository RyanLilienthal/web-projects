	A contour self portrait<br>
    I’m looking into a mirror making a contour drawing of myself while recording a dictation on my iPhone. I start by placing my pen ... and it’s an ordinary pen that I hold between my thumb, index finger, and middle finger. A shadow casts from my hand onto the paper on which I’ll draw, which is a recycled sheet from the program of my son‘s bar mitzvah. I start towards the center of the page near the edge of my nose and come around under the nostril and up and over and I catch the bridge of my nose with the reading glasses on, then come around the side and I’m seeing on my right eye in the reflection. There’s some reflection in the rim of these glasses,  which are otherwise clear so I can see through them and to come over the bridge and then back over up on top of that side the glasses but because it’s thicker I come underneath the edge and around the side but I can see through the lens to the lower lid of my eye which comes through slightly but I am, in fact, looking over the edge of the glasses. I see my right eye but it is reflected on the left side of my face in the mirror from which I am drawing. I move the pen over the eyelid the dark area and then I come back over over the lid and around and back to the glasses to the edge meets my sideburns. I draw from my eyebrow back over the side of my face to the edge of my hair and I hit the top of the page. I draw back down to where the glasses are hanging and it’s around again back down to the other side of my nose and then down to my upper lip. I continue on to that side seeing my lips move in the mirror reflection as I dictate this and I can just see my bottom my teeth with my lip under it and my tongue inside. I draw around the lower lip with the shadow underneath my lower lip in a crease, and I know there are so many more creases, below my chin and then underneath another loop back on the other side down to the neck. I see the top of my shirt and I follow the color of that to where it meets my neck and then back down again through where my neck is following the shadow of the contour of the folds in my neck and then back up again towards the other side of my face. The shadow cast under my nose or on the right side of my safe face and the other side of the glasses comes around my cheekbone and the ear of the other side, where that I did not draw the cheek earlier. I notice the top of the ear aligns with my other eye the one on the left side of my face. I realize that I have misplaced the location of this line. I add further lines to attempt a change in location of that contour up to the bridge of my nose where it meets the glasses and where my eyes come together. I find the edge of the glasses again and the interior of the glasses and return back to the sideburns. I’m going up to the top of the page and back to the interior of the glasses and on the inside of the nose. Following my glasses, the contour touches my cheek and moves to the other ear on the other side of my face. My mouth is slightly opened when I am not talking and the contour of my lip moves into the shadow that forms my cheek. I then follow the line to the edge of my jaw and scratch in darker shadows under my face. I bring my eye down on the left side of my face and build volume around my eyebrow. I obserce that I have overdrawn one section of the drawing and that the shadow on the right side of my face. I’m going to try to switch pens to see what that will do as I return to the landscape and contours my face. Using a single line I see if that makes a difference in how this drawing appears.
