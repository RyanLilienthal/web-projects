      <p class="question">Ryan Q: Why did you chose a binder clip as your object?</p>


      <!-- Answer 1 by Student 2 --  Write the first answer using the format below: 
        Student Name: lorem ipsum dolor sit. -->
      <p class="answer">Ryan A: It was on my desk and seemed to be the easiest object with which to work. I also liked the spring mechanics in this simple object.</p>

      <!-- Question 2 by Student 1 -->
      <p class="question">Ryan Q: Speaking of like, what have you liked most about working with your binder clip?</p>

      <!-- Answer 2 by Student 2 -->
      <p class="answer">Ryan A: I've learned that binder clips have personality and can do all sorts of things, whether falling within their intended use or beyond that. It's a powerful object and enormously useful.</p>

      <!-- Question 3 by Student 1 -->
      <p class="question">Ryan Q: What have you found to be most challenging about using the binding clip as your object?</p>

      <!-- Answer 3 by Student 2 -->
      <p class="answer">Ryan A: While I liked my object, I think other students in the class produced inspired studies, posters and icons related to their objects. My object left me in a bind.</p>

      <!-- Question 4 by Student 1 -->
      <p class="question">Ryan Q: If you were to chose a different object, what would it be and why?</p>

      <!-- Answer 4 by Student 2 -->
      <p class="answer">Ryan A: I've been thinking about my glasses. In search of visionary thinking and insight, glasses are an object that help you see. And, as I'm writing this, I wonder if glasses are a singular or plural object. A quick look up indicates that glasses are plural, but a singular pair.</p>
